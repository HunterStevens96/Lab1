A Model of a door that was made for an independant study class. We had a reference photo to create a full 3D model out of. 
The challenging aspects of it was learning how to make accurate perspective measurement to get the facade to look as accurate as possible. The techinique I learned quite a bit was comparing different dimensions of each piece to each other, which helped with making sure that the measurement was as accurate as possible. I used tools in Blender like the bevel, mirror modifier, extrude, and loop cut.

After making the model, I grabed textures and materials to match the color and texture asthetics to the refernecce image.
